Certainly, let's expand on the entities and include security considerations. We'll also cover the relationships between entities.

1. Entity Definitions:
Student Entity:
Attributes:
Student ID
Name
Email
Age
...
Teacher Entity:
Attributes:
Teacher ID
Name
Email
Subject
...
Course Entity:
Attributes:
Course ID
Title
Description
...
Degree Entity:
Attributes:
Degree ID
Title
Level (e.g., Undergraduate, Graduate)
...
University Entity:
Attributes:
University ID
Name
Location
...
2. Entity Relationships:
Student - Course (Many-to-Many):
A student can enroll in multiple courses.
A course can have multiple students.
Student - Degree (Many-to-One):
A student can be associated with one degree.
A degree can have multiple students.
Teacher - Course (One-to-Many):
A teacher can teach multiple courses.
A course is taught by one teacher.
University - Degree (One-to-Many):
A university can offer multiple degrees.
A degree is offered by one university.
3. Security Considerations:
Authentication and Authorization:
Implement user authentication for students, teachers, and any other roles.
Define access control policies based on roles.
Utilize Spring Security for securing endpoints.
Data Encryption:
Implement encryption for sensitive data like passwords.
Use HTTPS to secure data transmission.
Input Validation:
Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Assign different roles to users (e.g., student, teacher) and restrict access based on roles.
Auditing and Logging:
Implement logging mechanisms to track user activities.
Set up auditing for sensitive operations.
Secure Communication:
Use secure communication protocols for microservices interactions.
Implement proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configurations.
4. Jira Epics and Tasks:
Security Epic:
Tasks:
Implement user authentication.
Set up authorization roles.
Implement encryption for sensitive data.
Implement input validation for all endpoints.
Set up role-based access control (RBAC).
Implement auditing and logging.
Ensure secure communication between microservices.
Entity Management Epics:
Tasks:
Create CRUD operations for Student, Teacher, Course, Degree, and University entities.
Define and implement relationships between entities.
5. Documentation:
Security Documentation:
Include a section in your Confluence documentation that explains the implemented security measures, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):
Create an ERD in Confluence to visually represent the relationships between Student, Teacher, Course, Degree, and University entities.
This provides a more comprehensive structure, considering entities, relationships, and security aspects for a well-rounded microservices project. Adjustments can be made based on specific project requirements and domain intricacies.
