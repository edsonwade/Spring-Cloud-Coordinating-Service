The objectives of the "Student" and "Teacher" microservices can vary based on the requirements and goals of your application. Here are some common objectives for each:

Student Microservice:

Student Management:

Maintain a database of student information.
Allow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records.
Enrollment and Courses:

Manage student enrollment in courses.
Provide information about the courses a student is currently enrolled in.
Grades and Academic Records:

Track and manage student grades and academic records.
Provide a history of courses taken and grades achieved.
Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication for students.
Enforce access control to ensure that students can only access their own information.
Teacher Microservice:

Course Management:

Maintain a database of courses offered.
Allow CRUD operations on course records.
Grade Submission:

Enable teachers to submit grades for students in the courses they teach.
Handle the grading process, including validation and recording of grades.
Course Material and Resources:

Manage and provide access to course materials, resources, and announcements.
Facilitate communication between teachers and students.
Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication for teachers.
Enforce access control to ensure that teachers can only access and modify information related to the courses they teach.
Shared Responsibilities:

Integration with Eureka Server:

Register with the Eureka Server for service discovery and registration.
Integration with Kafka (if applicable):

Consume and/or produce Kafka messages for relevant events (e.g., grade submission, enrollment).
API Gateway Integration:

Define API endpoints that can be accessed through the API Gateway.
Implement secure communication between microservices.
Integration with Databases:

Connect to the appropriate databases (e.g., PostgreSQL for one, MongoDB for the other) to store and retrieve data.
By defining clear objectives for each microservice, you can ensure that they contribute meaningfully to the overall functionality of your application. These objectives can be refined based on the specific use case and business requirements of your educational or academic-related system.
