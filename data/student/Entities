A many-to-many relationship where a student can be enrolled in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students.
Teacher-Course Relation:

A many-to-many relationship where a teacher can be assigned to multiple courses, and a course can have multiple teachers.
User-Role Relation:

A one-to-many relationship where a user can have one or more roles (e.g., STUDENT, TEACHER).
Main Functionality:
Student Service:

Manages student profiles and course enrollments.
Enforces authentication and authorization for student-related operations.
Teacher Service:

Manages teacher profiles and course assignments.
Enforces authentication and authorization for teacher-related operations.
Course Service:

Example Scenarios:
A student logs in, views their profile, enrolls in a course.
A teacher logs in, views their profile, assigns themselves to teach a course.
An admin (with appropriate role) manages user roles, adds or removes courses, etc.
This structure allows for a clear separation of concerns, secure authentication, and authorization mechanisms, and well-defined relations between entities for a scalable and maintainable system.
