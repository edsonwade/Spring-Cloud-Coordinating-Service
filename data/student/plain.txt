Certainly, let's organize the documentation into a set of priorities tasks. I'll provide a high-level summary for each task, along with an estimated maximum time for completion. Keep in mind that these estimates are quite approximate and may vary based on the specific details of your implementation and team dynamics.

Priority Tasks for Project Documentation:
Project Overview and Objectives:

Provide a brief overview of the project's goals and objectives.
Estimated Time: 1 hour
Microservices Architecture:

Describe the overall microservices architecture, including services like API Gateway, Eureka Server, Authentication, etc.
Include a high-level diagram to illustrate the architecture.
Estimated Time: 2 hours
Entity Relationship and Functionalities:

Document entities (e.g., Student, Teacher, Course) with their properties and relationships.
Detail the functionalities of each microservice (Student Service, Teacher Service, etc.).
Estimated Time: 3 hours
Authentication and Authorization:

Explain how authentication and authorization are handled in the system.
Document the security mechanisms, such as JWT.
Estimated Time: 2 hours
Docker Compose Configuration:

Provide a Docker Compose configuration for local development.
Include services like databases, Kafka, Prometheus, etc.
Estimated Time: 3 hours
Kubernetes Deployment:

Document the Kubernetes deployment configuration for all services.

Estimated Time: 2 hours
Deployment and Rollback Procedures:

Outline procedures for deploying new releases and rolling back in case of issues.
Include Helm rollback and Kubernetes deployment strategies.
Estimated Time: 2 hours
Documentation Review and Refinement:

Review and refine the documentation for clarity and completeness.
Address any gaps or inconsistencies.
Estimated Time: 2 hours
Additional Considerations:
Team Collaboration:

Set aside time for team discussions and collaboration to ensure everyone is aligned.
Allow for flexibility based on feedback and adjustments.
Jira Epics and User Stories:

Break down these documentation tasks into Jira epics and user stories for better tracking.
