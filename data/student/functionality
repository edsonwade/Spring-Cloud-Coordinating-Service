Let's define the main functionalities and purposes of each service:

Course Service:

Manages information related to academic courses.
May handle operations such as creating, updating, and deleting courses.
Provides APIs for retrieving course details and related information.
Handles interactions with the Course Database.
Student Service:

Manages information related to students.
May handle operations such as creating, updating, and deleting student profiles.
Provides APIs for retrieving student details and related information.
Handles interactions with the Student Database.
Teacher Service:

Manages information related to teachers.
May handle operations such as creating, updating, and deleting teacher profiles.
Provides APIs for retrieving teacher details and related information.
Handles interactions with the Teacher Database.
Main Relations:

Student-Teacher Relation:

A student service may have information related to courses they are enrolled in.
A teacher service may have information related to courses they are teaching.
There could be a many-to-many relationship between students and courses, and between teachers and courses.
Course-Database Relation:

Each service interacts with its respective database for data storage.
The Course Service interacts with the Course Database for course-related data.
The Student Service interacts with the Student Database for student-related data.
The Teacher Service interacts with the Teacher Database for teacher-related data.
Functional Responsibilities:

Each service is responsible for managing and exposing APIs related to its domain (e.g., courses, students, teachers).
Services handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their respective entities.
Interaction with databases is encapsulated within each service.
Example Scenario:

A student may enroll in multiple courses.
Each course may have multiple students and teachers.
Teachers may be assigned to teach multiple courses.
The Course Service manages the overall course catalog.
The Student Service manages student profiles and enrollments.
The Teacher Service manages teacher profiles and course assignments.
The main goal is to have a modular and scalable architecture where each service focuses on a specific business domain, and the relations between them are defined based on the requirements of the application. This allows for flexibility and maintainability in the long run.
