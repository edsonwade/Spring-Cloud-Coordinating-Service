API Gateway:

Handles external API requests.
Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
Eureka Server:

Manages service registration and discovery.
Student and Teacher Services:

Microservices handling specific functionalities related to students and teachers.
Interact with their respective databases.
Course Service:

Microservice for managing courses.
Interacts with its respective database.
Notification Service:

Microservice responsible for handling notifications.
Communicates with its database.
Kafka Broker:

Message broker for asynchronous communication between microservices.
Allows for event-driven architecture.
Authentication (Auth) Service:

Handles user authentication.
May use JWT for token-based authentication.
Database Services:
