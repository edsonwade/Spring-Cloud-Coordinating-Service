Creating a Docker Compose file for your described scenario involves defining services for each component (API Gateway, Eureka Server, Student Service, Teacher Service, Prometheus, etc.) and specifying the necessary configurations. Below is a simplified example of a Docker Compose file. Please adjust it according to your project's structure, dependencies, and configurations:

Explanation:

eureka-server: Eureka Server for service registration and discovery.
api-gateway: Your API Gateway service.
student-service and teacher-service: Microservices communicating through the API Gateway.
mongodb-db and postgres-db: Database services for student and teacher services.
prometheus: Monitoring service.
grafana: Dashboard and visualization service for Prometheus.
health-check: A simple health check for the API Gateway.
This is a basic setup, and you may need to adjust configurations based on your specific project requirements, such as environment variables, networking, security, and more. Additionally,
consider setting up caching mechanisms within your API Gateway as needed.
