1. Create Epics in Jira:
Epic 1: Microservices Architecture Setup

Sub-tasks:
Set up Spring Boot projects for Student Service, Teacher Service, API Gateway, Eureka Server, and Config Server.
Implement basic service functionalities without interactions.
Configure Docker for each service.
Set up a Docker Compose file for local development.
Epic 2: Service Communication and Discovery

Sub-tasks:
Implement service-to-service communication using Spring Cloud Feign.
Integrate Eureka Server for service registration and discovery.
Configure Spring Cloud Config Server for centralized configuration management.
Epic 3: Database Integration

Sub-tasks:
Set up MongoDB for Student Service.
Set up PostgreSQL for Teacher Service.
Implement data models and repository patterns.
Test database connections and basic CRUD operations.
Epic 4: API Gateway and Caching

Sub-tasks:
Set up Spring Cloud Gateway.
Configure routes for services in the API Gateway.
Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
Epic 5: Monitoring and Health Checks

Sub-tasks:
Integrate Prometheus for monitoring.
Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization.
Implement health checks in each microservice.
2. Create a Kanban Board in Jira:
Backlog:

Populate the backlog with all the tasks from the epics.
To Do:

Move tasks from the backlog to the "To Do" column as they are ready for implementation.
In Progress:

Move tasks from "To Do" to "In Progress" as development begins.
In Review:

After development, move tasks to "In Review" for code reviews and testing.
Done:

Move tasks to "Done" when they are completed and tested successfully.
3. Create Confluence Documentation:
Project Overview:

Write a high-level project overview, including goals, stakeholders, and a brief description of microservices.
Architecture Documentation:

Document the overall microservices architecture, including service interactions, data flow, and external dependencies.
Installation Guide:

Provide step-by-step instructions on setting up and running the microservices locally using Docker.
Configuration Management:

Explain how configuration management is handled using Spring Cloud Config Server.
Monitoring and Logging:

Document the monitoring setup with Prometheus and Grafana, including key metrics and dashboards.
Health Checks:

Describe how health checks are implemented in microservices.
API Gateway Documentation:

Provide details on the API Gateway, including routes, caching strategies, and how it interacts with microservices.
Database Integration:

Document the database setup for MongoDB and PostgreSQL, including schema design.
4. Execute the Kanban Board:
Start working on tasks based on their priority and dependencies.
Hold regular sprint planning and retrospective meetings.
Adapt the Kanban board as needed throughout the month.
5. Iterate and Improve:
Continuously review and refine the Kanban board based on team feedback and project progress.
Update Confluence documentation as the project evolves.
Remember, this is a generalized example, and you should tailor it to your project's specific needs and complexities.
